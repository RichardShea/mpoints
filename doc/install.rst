Installation
============

The package can be easily installed via `pip`, a popular package management system for Python. In the terminal, simply enter the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install mpoints

If you are using virtual environments (with conda), make sure that you install the package in the intended environment.

Note: when installing `mpoints` on Windows, you may be prompted to install Visual C++ Build Tools if this is not already installed.
